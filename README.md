## Overview

  

**Glim API** is a powerful and flexible dynamic API generator designed to simplify the creation of RESTful APIs with FastAPI. With built-in authentication, rate limiting, and localization, Glim API provides a robust framework tailored to meet diverse needs. Configure everything easily with a `config.toml` file, making setup quick and painless.

  

> **Note:** Glim API is currently under active development. You might encounter some bugs or incomplete features. We appreciate your feedback and contributions to help improve the project!

  

## üöÄ Features

  

-  **Dynamic API Generation**: Effortlessly generate CRUD APIs based on your custom models.

-  **üîê JWT Authentication**: Secure your API endpoints with JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.

-  **‚ö° Rate Limiting**: Manage and control API usage with configurable rate limiting options.

-  **üåç Localization**: Support for multiple languages and currencies, making your API globally accessible.

-  **üíæ Flexible Database Integration**: Seamless integration with MongoDB or a simple local database.

  

## üõ† Installation

  

To install Glim API, run the following command:

  

`pip install glimapi`

  
  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

  

Once installed, you can generate a `config.toml` file by running the following command:

  

`glimapi-generate-toml`

  

This command will create a `config.toml` file in your project directory which holds all the configuration settings for Glim API, allowing for extensive customization.

  

Additionally, the command will also generate a `middlewares` directory in your project root. You can add your custom middleware files to this directory to extend or modify the functionality of Glim API.

  

### Customizing `config.toml`

  

-  **Database Settings**: Choose between MongoDB or a local database; set up connection details accordingly.

-  **Server Settings**: Define the host and port settings for FastAPI.

-  **JWT Authentication**: Configure JWT parameters, including secret keys and token expiration.

-  **Caching**: Enable Redis caching and specify connection details.

-  **Rate Limiting**: Set limits on the number of requests allowed per minute.

-  **Models**: Define your API models, including fields, filters, and relationships.

  

## üíª Usage

  

### Starting the Glim API

  

Kickstart your API with a single command:

  

`glimapi-start`

  

### Help Command

  

Need assistance? Access the help command:

  

`glimapi-help`

  

### Generate Configuration File

  

Regenerate or create the `config.toml` file with:

  

`glimapi-generate-toml`

  

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements and Roadmap
